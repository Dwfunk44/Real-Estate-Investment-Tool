# Real Estate Data Science Project

## Overview
This repository contains a data science project focusing on predicting house sale prices in King County, Washington, which includes Seattle. The project leverages various data science techniques to explore, clean, and analyze the dataset, ultimately building regression models to predict house prices based on multiple features.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about house sales in King County, including homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015. The dataset includes features like the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and more.

### Key Variables:
- **id**: A notation for a house
- **date**: Date the house was sold
- **price**: Sale price (target variable)
- **bedrooms**: Number of bedrooms
- **bathrooms**: Number of bathrooms
- **sqft_living**: Square footage of the home
- **sqft_lot**: Square footage of the lot
- **floors**: Total floors in the house
- **waterfront**: Whether the house has a view of the waterfront
- **view**: Whether the house has been viewed
- **condition**: The condition of the house
- **grade**: The quality of the house
- **sqft_above**: Square footage above the basement
- **sqft_basement**: Square footage of the basement
- **yr_built**: Year the house was built
- **yr_renovated**: Year the house was renovated
- **zipcode**: Zip code of the house
- **lat**: Latitude of the house
- **long**: Longitude of the house
- **sqft_living15**: Square footage of the living room in 2015
- **sqft_lot15**: Square footage of the lot in 2015

## Objectives
- **Data Exploration**: Explore the dataset, handle missing data, and perform basic statistics and visualizations.
- **Data Cleaning**: Drop unnecessary columns, address outliers, and handle feature engineering.
- **Model Development**: Build linear regression models to predict the house prices.
- **Model Evaluation**: Use R² values to evaluate the performance of the models and fine-tune them using different techniques like Ridge Regression and Polynomial Regression.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary language used for analysis and modeling.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Seaborn**: For data visualization and statistical plotting.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For regression modeling, including linear regression, Ridge regression, and polynomial transformations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For documenting and running the Python code.

## Installation
Clone this repository and install the necessary libraries:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-estate-data-science.git
cd real-estate-data-science
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `Real_Estate_Price_Prediction.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
3. Run the code cells sequentially to explore the data, perform data wrangling, and build the regression models.
4. Review the visualizations and R² values to evaluate model performance.

## Project Structure
- `Real_Estate_Price_Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code and analysis steps.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python libraries for the project.
- `dataset/`: Directory containing the dataset used for analysis.
- `images/`: Directory for storing any images, visualizations, or screenshots.

## Results
- **Linear Regression Model**: The model was able to predict house prices based on features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and waterfront view, achieving an R² score of approximately 0.49285.
- **Ridge Regression**: A Ridge regression model was used to improve performance, achieving an R² score of approximately 0.647.
- **Polynomial Regression**: A polynomial transformation was applied to the features, which improved the R² score to approximately 0.75133.
